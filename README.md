# NeatapticTS

NeatapticTS offers flexible neural networks; neurons and synapses can be removed with a single line of code. No fixed architecture is required for neural networks to function at all. This flexibility allows networks to be shaped for your dataset through neuro-evolution, which is done using multiple threads.

### Further notices

NeatapticTS is based on [Neataptic](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic). Parts of [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) where used to develop Neataptic.

The neuro-evolution algorithm used is the [Instinct](https://medium.com/@ThomasWagenaar/neuro-evolution-on-steroids-82bd14ddc2f6) algorithm.
