/**
 * Placeholder for Browser memory benchmark harness (Phase 0 Step 4).
 * Intent: Provide a structure that can later be executed in a headless browser (e.g., via Playwright / Puppeteer)
 * to gather dev vs prod bundle metrics (build size, bytes/connection heuristic vs performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize where available).
 *
 * Current state: Skipped test with explanatory notes. Will be activated when browser harness scaffolding is added
 * (likely separate npm script invoking Playwright to run a page that loads the built bundles and posts back metrics).

    // Planned Implementation Outline:
    // 1. Build dev + prod bundles (webpack or existing build pipeline) capturing byte size.
    // 2. Launch headless browser, load harness page that constructs synthetic networks of sizes 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k, 50k.
    // 3. Use window.performance.now() for build/forward timings; attempt performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize (Chrome only) for heap.
    // 4. Send metrics back via console.log(JSON) or exposed global collected by an evaluate step.
    // 5. Aggregate similarly to Node harness with aggregateBenchMeasurements(); write artifact bench-phase0-browser.json.
    // 6. Merge/compare Node vs Browser metrics for documentation.
