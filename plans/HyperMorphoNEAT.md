# Hyper MorphoNEAT: The Next Evolution in Neuroevolution for TypeScript

Hyper MorphoNEAT is a proposed hybrid framework for neural network evolution, designed to unify the best ideas from Evo-Devo Networks, ES-HyperNEAT, and NeuroMorph Networks. Its goal is to create scalable, adaptable, and biologically-inspired neural networks that can grow, learn, and evolve in real time—mirroring the structure and function of a biological brain.

## Vision & Motivation

Hyper MorphoNEAT aims to be the ultimate neural evolution library for JS/TS, enabling:

- **Biologically-plausible growth:** Networks develop and adapt using genetic rules and environmental feedback, not just static topologies.
- **Scalable architectures:** Compact encodings allow brain-scale networks with millions of neurons and connections.
- **Dynamic adaptability:** Real-time morphogenesis and plasticity enable lifelong learning and specialization.
- **Hierarchical modularity:** Networks grow in layers and modules, supporting multi-scale control and processing.
- **Indirect encoding:** CPPNs and developmental rules generate structure, not just weights, for efficient evolution.

## Core Principles

### Mimic Biological Brain Growth

Networks grow and evolve based on genetic rules and experience, balancing global structure with local adaptability.

### Balance Structure & Flexibility

- Global patterns (modularity, symmetry, fractals) via developmental rules.
- Localized changes and specialization via morphogenetic processes.

### Dynamic, Environment-Driven Adaptability

Real-time plasticity and morphogenesis respond to task demands and environmental signals during runtime.

### Scalable, Efficient Encoding

Indirect encoding (CPPNs, rule-based genotypes) enables massive, coherent architectures.

### Integrated Feedback Mechanisms

Recursive interactions between growth, learning, and evolution for continuous improvement.

---

## Framework Components

### Evo-Devo Networks

- **Genetic Encoding for Rule-Based Development:** Genotypes encode rules for growing the substrate (neuron placement, structure).
- **Developmental Rules:**
  - Replication: Neurons clone or expand spatially.
  - Differentiation: Specialization based on position/activity.
  - Hierarchical Growth: Recursive module/layer creation.
  - Symmetry & Modularity: Bilateral symmetry, modular zones.
  - Emergent Complexity: Simple rules scale to fractal, modular hierarchies.

### ES-HyperNEAT

- **Evolvable Substrate Layout:** Spatial arrangement of neurons evolves for problem-specific geometries.
- **CPPNs for Connection Patterns:** Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks map spatial positions to connection weights and patterns.
- **Indirect Encoding:** CPPNs generate scalable, regular structures.
- **Hierarchical Regularity:** Large-scale structure enforced across modules.

### NeuroMorph Networks

**Morphogenesis (Localized Growth):**

NeuroMorph-inspired morphogenetic processes allow neurons and connections to grow dynamically during runtime, adapting to environmental signals or task-specific demands. This enables the network to expand only as much as needed, keeping resource usage efficient—crucial for JavaScript/TypeScript environments.

Local rules govern:

- **Axon growth:** Neurons form new connections with nearby or task-relevant regions, allowing the network to discover new pathways as needed.
- **Dendritic tree expansion:** Neurons dynamically expand their receptive fields, increasing complexity only when required by the task.
- **Synaptogenesis:** New synapses are created to improve performance, but only when activity or feedback signals indicate a need for greater connectivity.
- **Pruning:** Unneeded or inefficient connections are removed based on activity thresholds, error signals, or lack of contribution to performance. This keeps the network lean and focused.

## Pruning and Substrate Evolution: Efficient Growth in JS/TS

A key technical focus for Hyper MorphoNEAT is dynamic substrate evolution—the ability for neural networks to grow only as big and complex as needed, adapting in real time to the demands of the environment and the task. This is especially important in JavaScript/TypeScript, where memory and performance constraints require careful management of network size and complexity.

**How pruning works:**

- Connections and even neurons are periodically evaluated for usefulness.
- If a connection's activity falls below a threshold, or if it does not contribute to error reduction, it is pruned.
- Pruning is not just removal: it can trigger rewiring, allowing the network to adapt its topology for new challenges.
- The substrate (the spatial layout of neurons) evolves as the network grows and prunes, maintaining only the necessary complexity.

---

### TypeScript Example: Activity-Based Pruning

```typescript
// Prune connections with low activity
for (const conn of network.connections) {
  if (conn.activity < PRUNE_THRESHOLD) {
    network.removeConnection(conn);
  }
}

// Prune neurons with no incoming or outgoing connections
for (const neuron of network.neurons) {
  if (neuron.inDegree === 0 && neuron.outDegree === 0) {
    network.removeNeuron(neuron);
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Example: Dynamic Substrate Growth

```typescript
// Grow new neurons only when error remains high
if (network.error > GROW_ERROR_THRESHOLD) {
  network.addNeuron({ position: network.findGrowthRegion(), type: 'hidden' });
}

// Expand dendritic tree for high-activity neurons
for (const neuron of network.neurons) {
  if (neuron.activity > EXPAND_THRESHOLD) {
    neuron.expandDendrites();
  }
}
```

**Technical Notes for JS/TS Efficiency:**

- Networks should use sparse data structures (e.g., adjacency lists, maps) to avoid memory bloat.
- Pruning and growth operations should be batched and performed asynchronously when possible to avoid blocking the main thread.
- Substrate evolution should be incremental, with periodic checks to avoid unnecessary computation.
- Visualization and telemetry should reflect the current substrate size and complexity, helping users tune growth/pruning parameters for their environment.

**Benefits:**

- Networks remain as small and efficient as possible, growing only when needed and pruning excess.
- Enables brain-scale architectures in JS/TS without overwhelming memory or CPU.
- Supports lifelong learning and adaptation, with the ability to specialize or generalize as tasks change.

### Advanced Example: Adaptive Pruning and Growth Policy

```typescript
// Adaptive policy: prune aggressively if memory usage is high, grow if performance stagnates
if (getMemoryUsage() > MEMORY_LIMIT) {
  network.pruneLeastActiveConnections();
}
if (network.performanceStagnant()) {
  network.growNewModules({
    type: 'specialized',
    region: network.findUnderutilizedRegion(),
  });
}
```

**Summary:**  
NeuroMorph pruning and substrate evolution are central to Hyper MorphoNEAT's ability to efficiently manage network complexity in JS/TS. By growing only as needed and pruning excess, networks can scale to challenging tasks while remaining performant and resource-aware.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Initialization: Compact Genetic Encoding**

   - Seed genotypes encode developmental rules for substrate growth.
   - Rules define spatial layout, growth behaviors, and hierarchical patterns.
   - Development combines large-scale structure (CPPN-driven) and fine-grained morphogenesis.

2. **Substrate Growth**

   - Neurons are created/organized using developmental rules.
   - Produces global structure (modular zones, symmetry) and local specialization.
   - Growth mechanisms: fractal expansion, modular clustering, recursive division.

3. **CPPN-Driven Patterns**

   - CPPN evolves alongside substrate to map coordinates to connection weights.
   - Introduces global connectivity (fractal, hierarchical, spatially-sensitive links).
   - CPPN governs large-scale structure; morphogenesis refines details.

4. **Real-Time Morphogenesis**

   - During runtime, neurons/connections grow, prune, or adapt based on input, activity, or feedback.
   - Morphogenesis expands/specializes regions as needed.
   - Plasticity rules strengthen/prune connections during learning.

5. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Performance during training/task creates feedback loops:
     - Short-term: Plasticity adapts connection strengths.
     - Long-term: Developmental rules evolve based on morphogenetic feedback.

## TypeScript API Concepts & Examples

Below are conceptual TypeScript API sketches for Hyper MorphoNEAT. These are illustrative and will evolve as the architecture is implemented.

### 1. Defining Developmental Rules

```typescript
interface DevelopmentalRule {
  type: 'replication' | 'differentiation' | 'hierarchy' | 'symmetry';
  params: Record<string, any>;
}

const rules: DevelopmentalRule[] = [
  { type: 'replication', params: { axis: 'x', count: 2 } },
  { type: 'differentiation', params: { signal: 'activity', threshold: 0.8 } },
  { type: 'hierarchy', params: { levels: 3 } },
  { type: 'symmetry', params: { axis: 'y' } },
];
```

### 2. Creating a Hyper MorphoNEAT Network

```typescript
import { HyperMorhoNEAT } from 'neataptic-ts';

const hyperNet = new HyperMorhoNEAT({
  input: 8,
  output: 4,
  developmentalRules: rules,
  cppnConfig: { layers: 3, activation: 'tanh' },
  morphogenesis: { enabled: true, plasticity: 'hebbian' },
});
```

### 3. Evolving and Growing the Network

```typescript
// Evolve the network over generations
await hyperNet.evolve({
  generations: 100,
  fitness: (net) => evaluateTask(net),
  feedback: 'morphogenetic', // enables runtime adaptation
});

// Real-time morphogenesis during training
hyperNet.train(data, {
  morphogenesis: true,
  plasticity: {
    mode: 'activity-driven',
    pruneThreshold: 0.05,
    growThreshold: 0.9,
  },
});
```

### 4. Inspecting and Exporting the Network

```typescript
// Export to ONNX or visualize substrate
const onnxModel = hyperNet.exportToONNX();
hyperNet.visualizeSubstrate();

// Inspect modular structure
console.log(hyperNet.getModules());
```

### 5. Advanced Features (Future)

- Hierarchical Telemetry: Track growth, adaptation, and feedback at multiple scales.
- Custom Morphogenetic Hooks: Inject custom growth/pruning logic.
- Dynamic Objective Registration: Add/remove objectives during evolution (see README multi-objective features).
- Adaptive Complexity Budget: Expand/contract network limits based on performance slope.
