/**
 * TestWorker class for handling network evaluations in a Node.js environment using Worker Threads.
 *
 * This implementation aligns with the Instinct algorithm's emphasis on efficient evaluation of
 * neural networks in parallel environments. The use of Worker Threads allows for offloading
 * computationally expensive tasks, such as network evaluation, to separate threads.
 *
 * @see {@link https://medium.com/data-science/neuro-evolution-on-steroids-82bd14ddc2f6#4-constraints Instinct Algorithm - Section 4 Constraints}
 *
 * This class provides methods to evaluate neural networks and manage the worker process.
 *
 * @example
 * // Typical usage in an async context
 * (async () => {
 *   // example serialized dataset numbers placeholder
 *   const dataSet = [0, 1, 2];
 *   const cost = { name: 'mse' };
 *   const worker = new TestWorker(dataSet, cost);
 *   try {
 *     const mockNetwork = { serialize: () => [[0], [0], [0]] };
 *     const score = await worker.evaluate(mockNetwork);
 *     console.log('score', score);
 *   } finally {
 *     worker.terminate();
 *   }
 * })();
