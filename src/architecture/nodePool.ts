/**
 * NodePool (Phase 2 â€“ COMPLETE)
 * =============================
 * Lightweight object pool for `Node` instances mirroring (future) connection pooling patterns.
 *
 * Objectives:
 * 1. Reduce GC pressure during topology mutation / morphogenesis (frequent add/remove of nodes).
 * 2. Provide deterministic, fully-reset instances on `acquire()` so algorithms can assume a fresh state.
 * 3. Provide instrumentation (reused vs fresh, highWaterMark, recycledRatio) consumed by benchmarks.
 * 4. Serve as a future anchor for slab-backed / SoA node state (Phase 3) without altering the public API.
 *
 * Phase 2 Deliverables Implemented Here:
 * - acquire / release with thorough reset and defensive scrub on release.
 * - highWaterMark updated ONLY on release (tracks retained capacity not transient demand).
 * - Counters reusedCount & freshCount powering recycledRatio assertions.
 * - resetNodePool() for deterministic test harness setup.
 *
 * Deferred (Phase 3+): preWarm(count), adaptive trim(), leak pattern heuristics, slab field hydration.
