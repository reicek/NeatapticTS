 * Network instance, typed as any) is expected to be populated elsewhere in the training loop with
 * values such as:
 *  - l1Penalty, l2Penalty
 *  - dropoutApplied (fraction of units dropped last pass)
 *  - weightNoiseStd (effective std dev used if noise injected)
 *  - sparsityRatio, prunedConnections
 *  - any custom user extensions (object is not strictly typed to allow experimentation)
 *
 * Design decision: We return a deep copy to prevent external mutation of internal accounting state.
 * If the object is large and copying becomes a bottleneck, future versions could offer a freeze
 * option or incremental diff interface.

 *  3. If serialization fails (rare circular or unsupported types), a second JSON attempt is made
 *     inside the catch to avoid throwing and to preserve backwards compatibility (will still throw
 *     if fundamentally non-serializable).
 *
 * NOTE: This is intentionally minimal; for richer cloning semantics consider a dedicated utility.
