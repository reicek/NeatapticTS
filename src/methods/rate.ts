/**
 * Provides various methods for implementing learning rate schedules.
 *
 * Learning rate schedules dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training
 * process of machine learning models, particularly neural networks. Adjusting the
 * learning rate can significantly impact training speed and performance. A high
 * rate might lead to overshooting the optimal solution, while a very low rate
 * can result in slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima. These methods
 * offer different strategies to balance exploration and exploitation during training.
